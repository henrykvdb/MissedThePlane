    ~ Tutorial: New controls explanation

- Browser
    - paging
    - cooldown on reads to server

- More levels
- Safety checks everywhere: what if level can't be loaded, error during editing, etc

Nice to have
- Smoother UI / animations
- Level editor plane/pilot position = closest valid position if touch position is not valid
- Show selected tile when walking (highlight/arrow model on target tile?)
- Improved cutscenes/story
- Try-catch-send-error around entire program so we can see when games are crashing
- Settings menu: Write us anything box
- Water animations
- Level spawn animation
- Scroll bar momentum

Marketing
- Epic trailer
- Voxel isometric games -> almost no results -> make some reddit/medium threads or something
