Should do
- Performance fix: text -> change everything
- Performance fix: sprite overlay -> background alpha cam + ...?
- Maybe some story? explain why plane is flying
~ Seed fix
- Tutorial
    ~ New controls explanation
- UI
    - Decorate main menu
    ~ Hide UI of levelEdit when in pause (at least tile drawer so it doesn't overlap with settings/about)
- Ads
    - GDPR & child protection laws
    - Google billing: Remove ads in-app purchase
- More levels
- Safety checks everywhere: what if level can't be loaded, error during editing, etc
- Better level editor tile order
- Keep nav bar hidden
- Space level name
- Reviews
    - Settings menu button
    - Review prompt every n levels?

Nice to have
- Smoother UI / animations
- Level editor plane/pilot position = closest valid position if touch position is not valid
- Show selected tile when walking (highlight/arrow model on target tile?)
- Improved cutscenes/story
- Try-catch-send-error around entire program so we can see when games are crashing
- Settings menu: Write us anything box
- Water animations
- Level spawn animation
- Scroll bar momentum
- No progress lost popup when no changes (=> when same level string)

Marketing
- Epic trailer
- Voxel isometric games -> almost no results -> make some reddit/medium threads or something
