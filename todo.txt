We should make this
- more levels
- better tutorial?
- explain story briefly

Nice to have
- [SPACE TO START] splash screen tween
- grass <-> mountain animation
- cutscenes/story
- plane starts landing earlier
- landed plane collision / z sort fix
- water animations
- sine wave through level (or make level go up and down)

Android
- Relative positioning (scaling)
- Tap movement (replaces arrow keys)
- Trigger button (replaces SPACE)
- Update tutorial controls explanation
- Level editor
- Ads
- Remove ads in-app purchase
- Level editor share/import
