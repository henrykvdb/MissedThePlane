Absolutely essential
- levels
- tutorial

We should make this
- game complete/lose trigger
- music: instant/repeat load fix
- compress music properly
- fix earth pattern under mountains
- center pilot
- indicate button block visually
- menu
    - level popup
- sound effects
    - button blocked
    - level complete
    - menu button click

Nice to have
- cutscenes/story -> imo basic story should be in todo, everyone finds concept hilarious
- menu animations?
- pilot
    - animations
    - make mouth more dark/red (almost skincolor now)
- water animations
- sine wave through level (or make level go up and down)
