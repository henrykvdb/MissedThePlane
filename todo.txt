    - Game scene update
    ~ Use seperate sprites for shift arrows/tool button toggles instead of tint
    ~ Hide UI of gamescene when in pause
    ~ Hide UI of levelEdit when in pause (at least tile drawer so it doesn't overlap with settings/about)
- Get an actual font
- Level editor
    - save dialog + actually save in local prefs
    - Entire publish system + winnable check
    - Pilot/Plane direction to center
    - database
    ~ Fix placing block through drawer UI bug
