Should do
- Tutorial
    - Re-add
    - New controls explanation
- UI
    - Overlay main menu
        - about + credits: Markus credit (ui info menu with contact email? -> i'd say website but we can ask)
    - Levels menu overhaul (better scalability, seperation user levels)
    - Level browser / User levels / Your levels
    - Game scene update
- Get an actual font
- Level editor
    - export/import dialog
    - Entire publish system
    - Check if pilot/plane not in inaccessible on start
    - database?
- Ads
    - Admob: Add
    - Google billing: Remove ads in-app purchase
- More levels
- fix navigation bar reappearing (onResume instead of onStart?)

Nice to have
- Show selected tile when walking (highlight/arrow model on target tile?)
- Improved cutscenes/story
- Water animations
- Level spawn animation

Marketing
- Epic trailer
- Voxel isometric games -> almost no results -> make some reddit/medium threads or something
