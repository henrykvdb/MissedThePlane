To get something releaseable:
- Barebones tutorial
- Mail markus to ask how he wants to be credited

Should do
- Tutorial
    - Re-add
    - New controls explanation
- UI
    - Decorate main menu
    ~ Hide UI of gamescene when in pause
    ~ Hide UI of levelEdit when in pause (at least tile drawer so it doesn't overlap with settings/about)
- Get an actual font
- Level editor
    - save dialog + actually save in local prefs
    - Entire publish system + winnable check
    - database extra fields like plays/clears etc
- Ads
    - Admob: Add
    - Google billing: Remove ads in-app purchase
- More levels
- Safety checks everywhere: what if level can't be loaded, error during editing, etc
- Better level editor tile order
- Database access mode -> make secure!

Nice to have
- Show selected tile when walking (highlight/arrow model on target tile?)
- Improved cutscenes/story
- Try-catch-send-error around entire program so we can see when games are crashing
- Write us anything box
- Water animations
- Level spawn animation
- Scroll bar momentum
- Better runway support
- No progress lost popup when no changes

Marketing
- Epic trailer
- Voxel isometric games -> almost no results -> make some reddit/medium threads or something
