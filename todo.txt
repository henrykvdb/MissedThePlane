Nice to have
- grass <-> mountain animation
- cutscenes/story
- plane starts landing earlier
- landed plane collision / z sort fix
- menu animations?
- water animations
- sine wave through level (or make level go up and down)

Android

- Tap movement (replaces arrow keys)
- Trigger button (replaces SPACE)
- Update tutorial controls explanation
- Level editor
- Ads
- Remove ads in-app purchase
