Absolutely essential
- levels
- tutorial

We should make this
- pilot center animation
- plane starts landing earlier
- indicate button block visually
- sound
    - button blocked
    - level complete
    - menu button click
    - compress music properly

Nice to have
- wasd also moves pilot
- cutscenes/story -> imo basic story should be in todo, everyone finds concept hilarious
- landed plane collision
- menu animations?
- water animations
- sine wave through level (or make level go up and down)
