We should make this
- check our TODO's in project
- more levels
- better tutorial?
- pilot center animation
- explain story briefly
- sound
    - button blocked
    - level complete
    - menu button click
    - compress music properly

Nice to have
- cutscenes/story
- plane starts landing earlier
- landed plane collision / z sort fix
- menu animations?
- water animations
- sine wave through level (or make level go up and down)
