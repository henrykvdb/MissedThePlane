Should do
- Tutorial
    - Re-add
    - New controls explanation
- Levels menu overhaul (better scalability, seperation user levels)
- Get an actual font
- Make menu overlay
- Level editor
    - basic
    - export/import
    - Model shift, +-, rotate buttons
    - database?
- Ads
    - Admob: Add
    - Google billing: Remove ads in-app purchase
- Markus credit (ui info menu with contact email? -> i'd say website but we can ask)
- More levels
- fix navigation bar reappearing (onResume instead of onStart?)
- Fix [TAP TO START]

Nice to have
- Show selected tile when walking
- Improved cutscenes/story
- Water animations
- Level spawn animation

Marketing
- Voxel isometric games -> almost no results -> make some reddit/medium threads or something
